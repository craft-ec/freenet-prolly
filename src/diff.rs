//! What changed between two trees, without reading the parts that did not.
//!
//! `diff(a, b)` is what sync is: "here is the head I have, here is the head I
//! was just told about — what is different?" Live queries, keepers and the
//! per-device overlay are the same question asked of two roots.
//!
//! # The one shortcut
//!
//! A node's id is the hash of its bytes, so **equal id ⇒ equal subtree**. When
//! both sides stand on a child slot that begins at the same key and carries the
//! same id, everything under it is identical and is skipped whole — in both
//! trees, at whatever level it is found. Content-defined boundaries make the
//! two trees re-align a node or two after each edit, so the shortcut starts
//! firing again immediately.
//!
//! It fires on the ID and on nothing else. Equal aggregates, equal first keys
//! and equal lengths are all things two different subtrees can have.
//!
//! # Compare before descending
//!
//! A child's id and first key live in its PARENT, so the comparison costs
//! nothing: [`SlotCursor`] stands on a slot and loads the child only when the
//! ids disagree. This is the whole cost argument. A diff built on entry-level
//! cursors would have walked a root-to-leaf path in each tree before it could
//! say "both at the start of a node", paying `height` reads per tree for every
//! subtree it then skipped — on a cold tree, network fetches of blocks the diff
//! is about to declare irrelevant.
//!
//! So: `a == b` reads **nothing**. Identical contents reached by different
//! histories are the same case — the trees are history-independent, so equal
//! contents give equal roots.
//!
//! # One merge, not a rule per level
//!
//! At each position the highest level at which both sides have a slot beginning
//! at the current key is compared, and a side descends one level only when that
//! comparison fails, or when its slot begins before the other side's position
//! and must be opened to reach it. Lower levels are reached by the same loop —
//! two differing level-2 nodes very often share their first level-1 child, and
//! that is found without a special case. Different heights need no special case
//! either: levels are absolute, and equal ids imply equal levels.
//!
//! # Paging
//!
//! A page is the contiguous run of differences the limits allow, and [`Resume`]
//! says where to carry on — carrying **both roots**, because a diff whose roots
//! moved underneath it cannot give a coherent answer. `Range::after` is
//! refused for the same reason: it cannot carry them, so there is one resume
//! mechanism rather than two that can disagree.
//!
//! Resuming is by KEY, so each page re-opens the path down to where it carries
//! on. That is what lets a resume survive anything but the roots moving, and it
//! is what a small page costs. Measured, 189 changes over 6,000 entries
//! (`small_pages_cost_reads_and_repeat_new_blocks`):
//!
//! | page | pages | distinct blocks | lookups | `new_blocks` repeats |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 | 190 | 339 | 1,473 | 567 |
//! | 7 | 28 | 339 | 501 | 81 |
//! | 100 | 2 | 339 | 345 | 3 |
//! | unlimited | 1 | 339 | 339 | 0 |
//!
//! The SET of blocks touched does not change — 339 at every size. What changes
//! is how often each is asked for: paging one change at a time asks four times
//! as often. A caller with a cache in front of the store pays little of that;
//! one without pays all of it. So page a diff at whatever size the consumer
//! needs, but do not page a bulk sync at 1.
//!
//! # What is believed, and what is not
//!
//! Values are compared by `(id, len)` for a referenced value and by bytes for
//! an inline one, and a referenced value is NEVER fetched to compare it: one
//! encoding per value ([`Value::for_bytes`](crate::node::Value::for_bytes))
//! means equal bytes have equal ids, and different bytes cannot share one.
//! Aggregates are not consulted at all here.
