//! Where one node ends and the next begins.
//!
//! The decision is made per entry, *after* the entry is added to the open node:
//!
//! ```text
//! h32 = first 4 bytes (LE) of BLAKE3("PT01-split" ‖ level ‖ key)
//! split after this entry  iff  s_after ≥ MIN_SPLIT
//!                          and  h32 · λ⁴  <  (s_after⁴ − s_before⁴) · 2³²
//! ```
//! where `s` is the open node's [`NodeBuilder::logical_len`](crate::node::NodeBuilder::logical_len)
//! before and after the entry. The hash depends on the key alone, so a value
//! edit never changes *whether an entry can be* a boundary; the size term makes
//! a split ever more likely as the node grows (a Weibull hazard of shape 4),
//! which keeps node sizes tight around the mean instead of geometrically spread.
//!
//! Everything is integer arithmetic in `u128` (both sides stay below 2⁸⁹):
//! boundaries decide hashes, and float rounding is not portable across targets.
//!
//! An entry that would push the open node past `MAX_LOGICAL` closes the
//! node *before* it instead. That forced split is the only one not decided by
//! content; the hazard makes it vanishingly rare.
//!
//! `LAMBDA`, the limits and the hash domain are format constants: changing any
//! of them changes every root hash. They are pinned by `tests/vectors.txt`.
//! "Frozen" means frozen for PT01 code and vectors. Node size stays a measured
//! question until the phase-3 gate (put latency and the delegate's ops-per-round
//! cap may favour larger nodes); no stored data exists before then, so reopening
//! it costs only regenerated vectors.
