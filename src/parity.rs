//! Which blocks form a parity group, and what a group's symbols are.
//!
//! A node's children are coded in groups; each group gets three parity blocks
//! ([`crate::rs`]), and the node lists their ids. What this module decides is
//! the **membership** — and it has to decide it the same way for every reader,
//! because `pcount` is verified exactly and a disagreement about grouping is a
//! disagreement about whether a node is valid.
//!
//! **Groups are content-defined on the child's KEY, never on its cid.** A
//! child's cid changes on every write beneath it, so a cid-keyed boundary would
//! appear or disappear on roughly one write in eight per level and regroup two
//! neighbouring groups each time — less stable than counting, in exchange for
//! being more stable on the rare case. The tree's own chunking hashes the key
//! for the same reason.
//!
//! ```text
//! h = first 4 bytes (LE) of BLAKE3("PT01-pgroup" ‖ level ‖ key)
//! close after this member  iff  the group holds ≥ MIN_GROUP  and  h < 2³²/3
//! forced close             iff  the group holds MAX_GROUP
//! ```
//!
//! A final group shorter than `MIN_GROUP` folds into the previous one when the
//! two together are at most `MAX_GROUP`, and otherwise stands alone. **Only the
//! last group can ever be short**, because every earlier one closed on the rule
//! above, so there is at most one fold and it never cascades — which is what
//! makes the reserve arithmetic exact rather than approximate.
//!
//! On a LEAF the members are the referenced values, grouped **by size class
//! first** (§11's padding classes) and content-defined by key within a class.
//! Referenced values run from 1 KiB to 256 KiB with no size-tightness, so
//! grouping them by key alone would pad a mixed group to its largest and write
//! three parity blocks of that size: for private data, where every value in a
//! class is already padded to the class, the waste is instead zero.
//!
//! Inline values are not members of anything: they live in the leaf, and the
//! leaf is a member of its parent's group. The reserve arithmetic depends on
//! that.
